# WCI (**W**eb **C**lient **I**mplementation)

The purpose of this project is to study the feasbility and ultimately lay all relevant groundwork for porting all of the functionality of the Atellica Process Manager (APM) desktop application to a web application. This project is intended to house all research/prototype and finally the initial production-level code.

## Prerequisites
You will need the following installed to be able to build/run/test:
1. Install the latest LTS version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org)
2. Once node is installed, install Typescript: `npm install --g typescript`

## Install/update node_modules
After you initially pull down the repository or have updated the repository with latest code, run `npm install` to install/update all node_modules required to build/run/test the application.

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` to start the dev server. Once it's started, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. While the dev server is running, the app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Run `ng serve --port (Number)` to run the server on a port other than the default: 4200.
